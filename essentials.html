<h1>Uni Essentials</h1>
<section class="block">
<p>I have written about a few essentials during my time in uni and how they could help you. You could still make it through uni without any of these but your stay wouldn't be as good as it should have been.</p>

<p> Settling down quicker and finding your comfort zones, is all you need to kick-start your uni experience. I have outlined the top three things I need.    </p>
<p>My day revolves around my laptop, a high percentage of what I do involves staring at a screen. I am either completing my coursework, binge-watching Netflix shows, catching up on my favourite subscriptions on YouTube or just listening to music. By the way, I wear glasses and my eyes would love for me to take long breaks from the computer but I just don't care. </p>

<p id="highlight"> I would recommend taking the time to find great friends. Be nice to everyone you meet at induction week, freshers or even your flatmates; however, that shouldn't stop you from meeting new people. Having friends with similar interest or morals makes you more comfortable.
Being around friends should bring out the best version of you, not stress or makes you regret potential life choices. Also, meeting people from different cultures, international students are always willing to talk and meet someone new. It is fun learning about life in other countries, eating a new food or watching their shows. Warning: if you ever talk to an African do not ask what language they speak in Africa, it is a continent with hundreds of languages!</p>

<p>Secondly, I would recommend partaking in any activity that causes you to sweat ;). The only exercise uni students partake in, is walking in and out of lectures. Get a gym membership with a friend and create time to go at least once a week, going with a friend would encourage both of you to go. In addition, you can join a sporting society, playing volleyball or just dancing, they are all fun ways to burn those extra calories and keep the body ticking.</p>

<p>A cosy blanket for those long wintry nights, thinking about what choices you'd made earlier in the day. Reminiscing on previous high school memories or family trips; a warm, fluffy companion would be all you need. It is also important to realise that alone time is as important as any other activity you partake in. We need time to think, plan and just zone out. Sleep well and take long naps if you can. It helps and we also become more productive.</p>
