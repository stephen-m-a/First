  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <div>
  <p>Data storage and management by companies on the web has widened the scope on users’ vulnerability on the internet. Social media and various websites compel users to give data on all aspects of life, ironically private information is now public knowledge. Personal information privacy is fast becoming the most important ethical issue of the information age (Milberg, Burke, Smith, & Kallman, 1995, p. 65). Despite the fact, there are discrete procedures that preserve our safety on the web. This literature review will discuss personal data online with ways to scale down our susceptibility. Examining methods to reduce the data we share on the web and how our exact location can be excluded. Similarly, the new legislations on data would be reviewed and ways to take advantage would be outlined. Consider how to make full use of privacy notices by companies. Lastly, this review would explore features made available by applications that decrease our liability when using their products.</p>

  <p>Tasks are very difficult to complete without disclosing personal information, even to a trusted third party (Ackerman, Conor, & Reagle, 1999, p.1). Gross and Acquisti (2005, p.36) argue that in revealing personal information on social network users successfully make themselves susceptible to cyber and physical stalking, identity theft and surveillance.</p>

  <a id="Sharing"></a>
    <h2>Sharing Data Online</h2>
    <div>
<p>Registering on social media, websites and numerous applications results in filling forms containing sensitive data, including: location and memorable information (Irani, Webb, Li & Pu, 2011, p. 13). However, users are not required to provide 100% accurate information for every question. Be cautious when submitting authentic information when filling online registration forms.</p>

<p>Passwords are the gateway to digital life, so they must be kept safely. They are the first line of defense against trespass (Gehringer, 2002, p.369).  Avoid using passwords that are easy to predict. Change them regularly. Email addresses used for password resets should have a complex password, unauthorised access to these emails would cause harm.</p>

<p>The younger generation born into the information age take a more relaxed approach when sharing personal data.  As reported by (Young & Quan-Haase, 2009, p. 268), in a survey with 77 users of Facebook, 97.4% noted their school name and a staggering number (98.7%) posting an image of themselves. Despite only 7.9% of respondents revealing their physical address, it’s a lot easier to find where users live, as apps have location updates. Abstain from adding the location feature to posts as this reduces feasible risks.</p>

<p>Before posting pictures online, remove metadata. Metadata is stored in a file format that reveals details about the location of the device when the photo was taken (Huang, Fang, 2010, p. 436).  With time this information can be used to build up a pattern of your life.  Simply resize and re-save the image to remove the data.</p>

  <a id="Data"></a>
  <h2>Data protection and privacy</h2>
  <div>
  <p>Privacy is defined in terms of individual control over disclosure and subsequent uses of their personal information (Westin, 1967). Internet users all have a blueprint on the web, the data we present combined with cookies builds a digital profile for each entity. Customers have the right to erase data and also restrict or stop the processing of their data (“Data Protection Act”, 2018). Users now have an advantage; their information can now be deleted from the company’s servers on request. The General Data Protection Regulation of the EU (GDPR), will affect the processing of personal data in the EU (Albrecht & Philipp, 2016, 287). Furthermore, the way personal information is managed can be restricted and processing of any individual’s data can be barred.  The legislation would give EU citizens more control over their personal data and how it’s managed (Grant, 2018). This weakens the power companies have over user data, making customers more protected.</p>

<p>Reading online privacy notices would promote customer choice and reduce the risks of disclosing personal information online (Milne & Culnan, 2004, p. 15). These memos inform the user of what data will be saved and how it will be managed. Based on this information, the customer should decide if it can trust the company with its personal data. Judging that the benefits eclipses probable risks (Laufer & Wolfe, 1977, p. 24).  When handing over personal information, ensure it is transmitted securely. Examine the website’s connectivity before entering information, ensure the connection is encrypted.</p>

<p>In addition, privacy settings should be checked regularly, and it should be changed from their default settings. Privacy settings on social networks helps to reduce threats (Lucas & Borisov, 2008, p. 2). User information is a revenue source to many social media sites, as a result, privacy settings for such software are frequently changed. This exposes personal information during upgrades. After operating system upgrades, review what personal information applications have changed access to and subsequent changes.</p>

<p>Apps have features that allows a user to limit access to their feed. Restricting access to only family and friends increases security online (Gross & Acquisti, 2005, p.36) Also, reduce or delete any information posted on sites you do not use anymore.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <div>
  <p>Being safe must be the top priority when browsing the web. When filling registration forms, users are not obliged to be 100% accurate. Passwords should be kept securely. Hide location and the threats of metadata should be taken care off. Phone numbers should only be provided when it is compulsory. Data protection give users more control of their data. Privacy notices must be read, in order to decide if personal information will be shared. Privacy settings have to be regularly checked. Social media users should make their feeds private as it restricts access to your personal details. These are very important and if implemented accordingly, plays a large role in determining the safety of the user on the web.</p>
