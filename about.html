    <h1>Life in University</h1>
<section class="block">
    <p>University gives us the opportunity to learn a chosen skill, sadly :( I decided to pick Software Engineering. </p>

    <p>University life presents the first opportunity to live without full dependence on parents or siblings. Make day to day decisions that could affect your present and future life. However, the most important part of uni is discovering who you actually are!!</p>

    <p>In six months my cooking skills have drastically improved, I know because none of my friends has been diagnosed with food poisoning. My time management skills are also of the charts. Balancing Netflix time with Spotify, football on Sky, parties and the occasional class I decide to attend.</p>

    <p id="highlight">Despite all this madness, I found what keeps me sane. Church!! Going every Sunday talking to God is enough therapy for me. I would recommend.</p>

    <p>This website is going to showcase my literature review, discovery log, how I am able to effectively use pictures, videos and lastly the use of an external stylesheet. Getting 100% would definitely help my happiness ;) levels. Unlike Drake, If you're just reading this it's not too late, make a difference in someone's heart!! </p>
